# Introduction

Chest pain is a common reason for patients for patients to present to hospitals internationally and in New Zealand (NZ).[@bakerChestPainRural2011; @ellisManagementAcuteCoronary2013; @longBestClinicalPractice2017; @ministryofhealth2015; @rocheEffectivenessEmergencyNurse2017] These patients require assessment to exclude an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which can be a major clinical challenge .[@huisintveldFastFuriousLowRisk2017; @roffi2015ESCGuidelines2016@] More than 90% of these patients do not have ACS where this diagnosis is missed, mortality is doubled compared to those where the diagnosis is correctly made.[@bruinsslotPointofcareTestsSuspected2013; @rocheEffectivenessEmergencyNurse2017;@than2hDiagnosticProtocol2011;@pope2000] Historically, clinicians have been cautious of discharging patients presenting with chest pain leading to crowded emergency departments (ED), long stays, high costs and overburdened health systems.[@bingisserCardiacTroponinCritical2012; @goodacreHealthCareBurden2005; @goodacreSystematicReviewMetaanalysis2013]

In rural areas of New Zealand it is unknown how many people present to a health professional with chest pain.

In rural New Zealand there is blurring of the boundry between primary and secondary care. [**ref needed**] The rates of ACS have been shown to be lower in primary care than reported in emergency departments.[@bosner2009]

In NZ, this was addressed for hospitals and EDs in 2014 by a Ministry of Health directive that mandated the development and deployment of Accelerated Diagnostic Chest Pain Pathways (ADP) in emergency departments.[@thanICareACSImprovingCare2018] These ADP combine an objective scoring system, electrocardiogram (ECG) and a cardiac bio-marker to risk stratify patients with suspected cardiac origin chest pain into low, intermediate or high risk groups.[@christiansenLessMoreChest2017; @huisintveldFastFuriousLowRisk2017; @munroUseAcceleratedDiagnostic2015; @rocheReviewArticleDiagnostic2016; @than2HourDiagnosticProtocol2014; @thanICareACSImprovingCare2018]
