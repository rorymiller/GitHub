# Introduction

Chest pain is a common reason for patients for patients to present to hospitals internationally and in New Zealand (NZ).[@bakerChestPainRural2011; @ellisManagementAcuteCoronary2013; @longBestClinicalPractice2017; @ministryofhealth2015; @rocheEffectivenessEmergencyNurse2017] These patients require assessment to exclude an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which can be a major clinical challenge .[@huisintveldFastFuriousLowRisk2017; @roffi2015ESCGuidelines2016@] More than 90% of these patients do not have ACS where this diagnosis is missed, mortality is doubled compared to those where the diagnosis is correctly made.[@bruinsslotPointofcareTestsSuspected2013; @rocheEffectivenessEmergencyNurse2017;@than2hDiagnosticProtocol2011;@pope2000] Historically, clinicians have been cautious of discharging patients presenting with chest pain leading to crowded emergency departments (ED), long stays, high costs and overburdened health systems.[@bingisserCardiacTroponinCritical2012; @goodacreHealthCareBurden2005; @goodacreSystematicReviewMetaanalysis2013]

In rural areas of New Zealand it is unknown how many people present to a health professional with chest pain.

In rural New Zealand there is blurring of the boundry between primary and secondary care. 

In NZ, this was addressed for hospitals and EDs in 2014 by a Ministry of Health directive that mandated the development and deployment of Accelerated Diagnostic Chest Pain Pathways (ADP) in emergency departments.[@thanICareACSImprovingCare2018] These ADP combine an objective scoring system, electrocardiogram (ECG) and a cardiac bio-marker to risk stratify patients with suspected cardiac origin chest pain into low, intermediate or high risk groups.[@christiansenLessMoreChest2017; @huisintveldFastFuriousLowRisk2017; @munroUseAcceleratedDiagnostic2015; @rocheReviewArticleDiagnostic2016; @than2HourDiagnosticProtocol2014; @thanICareACSImprovingCare2018]
